This repository includes the code for my Bachelors Project.
The goal of the project is to build a Robotics/Art installation, inspired from The Myth of Sisyphus.


The file arm_control.py is a wrapper for the uarm api.
The util function find_port(), scans for serial devices and determines the port for the particular device.



The directory "uarm" is part of the official API and its the essential code to run the uArm Swift Pro robotic arm. -> Source: https://github.com/uArm-Developer/uArm-Python-SDK
